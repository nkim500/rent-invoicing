## How to Use

The Streamlit UI is available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). If it doesnâ€™t load, verify Docker containers are running with `docker ps`


### Initializing

To initialize the service, following data must be input (recommended to follow the order shown below). This can be done via Streamlit or a Python script:

1. **Invoice Settings**: Configure invoicing rules.
2. **Property**: Input property information.
3. **Water Meters**: Add initial water meters.
4. **Lots**: Add lots and link them to water meters.
5. **Tenants**: Create tenant profiles.
6. **Accounts**: Set up accounts linked to tenants and lots.

After the above steps, if initializing via Python, relationships between entities can be updated using these utility functions:

- Assign water meters to lots:  
  `app.utilities.queries.update_tenant_account_id`
- Assign tenants to accounts:  
  `app.utilities.queries.update_watermeter_lot_id`

#### Note:
- **Invoice Settings** dictate the billing cycle and fees. The billing cycle defaults to one month, with invoices due on the 1st of each month.
- The **overdue cut off days** attribute determines when an invoice becomes overdue (default is 10 days after the statement date).
- The **effective as of** date helps autofill the correct invoice settings for a given statement date.
- If any, values in **rental rate override** attribute of **Accounts** will take precedent over the default monthly rent in the invoice settings for monthly rent calculation.

### Manage Payments

- Filter payments by date to show entries from a specific period.
- Adjust the number of displayed payments with "Show more" or "Show less" buttons.
- Select a payment and confirm deletion if needed.

#### Add New Payments

- Check the "Select to record new payments" box to input new payments.
- Submit payment details (amount, payer info, dates).
- Number of payments for submission can be increased.
- For payments matching an existing entry (based on amount, date, account), confirmation will be required.
- Error is displayed for attempting to submit any payments with amount set to 0.

### Manage Receivables

#### Water Report Upload

- Upload monthly water meter readings by filling in the `template/water_report_template.xlsx` file. Make sure the column headers reflect the correct date ranges.

#### Recurring Receivables

- Monthly charges for rent, water, storage, and late fees are calculated and shown when selecting *See a preview of charges to be created for this billing cycle*, if they have not already been for the statement date. 

- Currently, **water usage report must be uploaded for the statement date to generate recurring charges**.

#### One-off Receivables

- Create one-off charges ("other rent") that will appear on invoices, by clicking on *Add receivable*. Confirm to avoid duplicating charges. 

### Generate Invoices

#### Generate Invoices
